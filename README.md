# firebase-claims-explorer

Is a tui tool which can be used to explore production claims for a firebase authentication. A common use case I've notices is that people have to use amazon provided cli to manually check what claims are applied to a specific user at a point of time.

Instead of a cli, this aims to be a easy to use TUI to explore a firebase auth database with the intent to view the custom claims for a user.
